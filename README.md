#### Testing

To run tests use `bun test` command.

#### Pull requests

- PRs should be created from `develop` branch
- PRs should be reviewed by at least Code Owner (see CODEOWNERS file)
- PRs should have scope in commit message (see commit messages section)
- PRs should have tests if it's possible
- PRs should have changeset file if it's needed (see release section)

### Release and publish

Packages are automatically published to npm when new PR is merged to `main` & `develop` branches.
To automate and handle process we use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and github action workflows.

<b>Before running `bun changeset` you have to pull `main` & `develop`</b>

To release new version of package you need to create PR with changes and add changeset file to your commit.

```bash
bun changeset
```

After PR is merged to `develop` branch with changeset file, github action will create new PR with updated versions of packages and changelogs.
